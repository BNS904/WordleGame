# What am I building?
The goal of this program is to create a basic game of Wordle. Worlde is a spelling game in which you are given six tries to guess a five-letter word. With each guess you are given hints about the letters of the correct word, these are shown as the colors for each text cell. Green means it is the correct letter in the correct position and yellow means it is the correct letter but not in the right position.

# Why am I building a TD game?
I am building this a form of entertainment for people who enjoy playing word games such as Wordle. This project also serves as a steppingstone for my work on making programs/games with GUI in Java. 

# Plan and effort going forward
This programâ€™s main goal is to provide entertainment and fun to the user. It will be used in that sense as well.
To make this game a reality there are a few various components that must be put in. These components are the word randomizer which chooses words from a list to get the given word for a specific round. There is then the cell movement so that the player can add and delete letters at will till they hit the enter button on the keyboard, which depending on the input may result in a win or cells highlighted for hints and moving to the next row.

#Instructions
Just run the program for the game window to appear and you can start inputting letters with the on-screen keyboard. When ready to submit a guess just hit the enter button and if it turns all green then you have guessed the correct word, otherwise the cells will light up colors based on your hints and move on to the next row. If on the last row you don't guess correctly the word will automatically switch to what the correct word was. When done with a game just click the reset button to start another round and have fun :)
